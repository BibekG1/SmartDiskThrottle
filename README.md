# 🚀 SmartDiskThrottle for Windows 10-11
**Automated, adaptive I/O throttling for Windows 10/11**  
*Silently detects sustained high I/O background processes and applies `Idle` priority to keep your system responsive — zero manual intervention required.*

> ✨ **New in v1.2**: Multi-instance I/O aggregation, garbage collection for zero memory drift, production-ready for 24/7 background execution.

---

## ⚡ One-Click Install (Recommended)

**Run this single line in Administrator PowerShell** to auto-download, install, and configure SmartDiskThrottle:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BibekG1/SmartDiskThrottle/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

### ✅ What This Does:
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1️⃣ | Downloads `SmartDiskThrottle.ps1` + `SmartDiskThrottle_Task.xml` to `C:\Scripts\` |
| 2️⃣ | Sets `RemoteSigned` ExecutionPolicy for current user (if needed) |
| 3️⃣ | Registers a Task Scheduler task that runs at login (with 1-min delay) |
| 4️⃣ | Verifies installation and shows next steps |

### 🔐 Safety First:
- ✅ Script is open-source — review `install.ps1` on GitHub before running
- ✅ Requires **Administrator** privileges (explicit UAC prompt)
- ✅ No registry edits, no service changes, no persistent modifications beyond the scheduled task
- ✅ Fully reversible: Disable task in Task Scheduler or reboot to undo

---

## 📦 Manual Deployment (Alternative)

Prefer to inspect files first? Here's how to install manually:
```markdown
### Step 1: Download Files
1. Download `src/SmartDiskThrottle.ps1` → Save to `C:\Scripts\SmartDiskThrottle.ps1`
2. Download `src/SmartDiskThrottle_Task.xml` → Save to `C:\Scripts\SmartDiskThrottle_Task.xml`

### Step 2: Import Task Scheduler Task
1. Open **Task Scheduler** as Administrator
2. Right-click **Task Scheduler Library** → **Import Task...**
3. Select `C:\Scripts\SmartDiskThrottle_Task.xml` → Click **OK**
4. Confirm the task is **Enabled** and set to run with **Highest privileges**

### Step 3: Verify
- Reboot or manually run the task once
- Check logs at `%TEMP%\SmartDiskThrottle.log`
- Open Task Manager → Details tab → Add `Priority` column → Throttled apps show `Idle`

## ⚙️ Configuration (Edit `SmartDiskThrottle.ps1` Top Section)

| Parameter | Default | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| `$diskThresholdMBps` | `15` | Raise to `20-25` if you download large files. Lower to `8-10` for aggressive throttling. |
| `$checkIntervalSec` | `15` | Decrease to `10` for faster reaction, increase to `30` to reduce CPU overhead. |
| `$sustainedChecks` | `3` | Must exceed threshold for 3 consecutive checks (45s total) before throttling. |
| `$cooldownChecks` | `5` | Prevents priority thrashing after a process drops below threshold. |

> 💡 **Tip**: After editing, re-run the one-liner installer to update the installed script.
```

## 🔍 How It Works

- 📊 Monitors `\Process(*)\IO Data Bytes/sec` performance counter every 15s
- 🔗 Aggregates I/O across multi-instance processes (`chrome`, `chrome#1`, `chrome#2`, etc.)
- 🛡️ Ignores 30+ protected Windows/system processes (see `$protectedProcesses` list)
- 📉 Applies `PriorityClass = Idle` only after sustained threshold breach (configurable)
- 🔄 Automatically restores `Normal` priority + cooldown when usage drops
- 🗑️ Self-managing log (rotates at 500 lines), zero memory drift via garbage collection

## 🛡️ Safety & Limitations

### ✅ What Makes It Safe:
| Feature | Why It Matters |
|---------|---------------|
| **Protected Process List** | Critical system processes (`svchost`, `TiWorker`, `MsMpEng`, etc.) are hard-coded to never be throttled |
| **Volatile Priority Changes** | `PriorityClass` adjustments exist only in RAM — reboot resets everything |
| **No Registry/Service Edits** | Pure PowerShell using native Windows APIs; no persistent system changes |
| **Transparent Code** | Fully open, well-commented, no obfuscation or hidden payloads |
| **Task Scheduler Integration** | Runs with standard Windows scheduling; easy to disable/uninstall |

### ⚠️ Known Limitations:
| Limitation | Workaround |
|------------|------------|
| **I/O Counter Includes Network** | Windows lumps disk + network I/O in standard counters. Heavy downloads may trigger throttling. Raise `$diskThresholdMBps` or add downloader processes to `$protectedProcesses`. |
| **English Counter Paths** | `\Process(*)\...` is localized on non-English Windows. For global deployment, use registry-based counter path lookup (advanced). |
| **Not True EcoQoS** | Achieves identical practical results via `Idle` priority. For kernel-level EcoQoS (leaf icon 🍃), pair with Process Lasso `PowerSaver`. |
| **Requires Admin to Install** | Task Scheduler registration needs elevated privileges. After install, the script runs with standard user permissions. |

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| **Script not running** | Verify Task is `Enabled`, runs with `Highest privileges`, and points to correct `.ps1` path in Task Scheduler |
| **False throttling on downloads** | Increase `$diskThresholdMBps` or add `'steam'`, `'qBittorrent'`, `'firefox'`, etc. to `$protectedProcesses` |
| **Log not updating** | Check execution policy: Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` in PowerShell |
| **Need to pause temporarily** | Disable task in Task Scheduler → re-enable when ready (no uninstall needed) |
| **Verify active throttling** | Task Manager → Details tab → Right-click headers → `Select columns` → ✅ `Priority` → Throttled apps show `Idle` |
| **Task fails to start** | Ensure `C:\Scripts\` folder exists and contains both `.ps1` and `.xml` files; check Task Scheduler "Last Run Result" |

## 🔐 Before You Run: Quick Safety Checklist

- ✅ **Verify the URL**: Ensure the one-liner points to `github.com/BibekG1/SmartDiskThrottle` exactly
- ✅ **Run as Administrator**: Right-click PowerShell → "Run as Administrator" (required for Task Scheduler)
- ✅ **Review the code** (optional but recommended): Open `install.ps1` and `SmartDiskThrottle.ps1` on GitHub to inspect
- ✅ **Understand the scope**: The script only downloads files, sets ExecutionPolicy for current user, and registers a scheduled task
- ✅ **Know how to undo**: Disable the task in Task Scheduler or reboot to instantly revert all changes

## 🔄 Updating SmartDiskThrottle

To update to a newer version:

```powershell
# Simply re-run the one-liner installer:
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BibekG1/SmartDiskThrottle/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer automatically:
- Backs up existing files (if needed)
- Downloads the latest `SmartDiskThrottle.ps1` and `.xml`
- Re-registers the Task Scheduler task with updated settings

---

## 🗑️ Uninstall

To completely remove SmartDiskThrottle:

```powershell
# Run in Administrator PowerShell:
Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName "SmartDiskThrottle" -Confirm:$false
Remove-Item "C:\Scripts\SmartDiskThrottle*" -Force
Remove-Item "$env:TEMP\SmartDiskThrottle.log" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

✅ All changes are reverted. Priority adjustments vanish on next reboot automatically.
